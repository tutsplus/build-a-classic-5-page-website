### Envato Tuts+ Course: Build a Classic 5 Page Website
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

The “5 page static website” is the bread and butter of web design. Even though it doesn’t have the ubiquitous presence online it once did, only if you are confident to create this classic type of site by hand can you really feel assured your fundamentals are on point.

This course will be an exercise in those fundamentals, covering the most essential skills of the trade via the creation of a five page small business site, using only HTML and CSS.

There’ll be no CMS, no JavaScript, no build tools. It’s just you and your code editor, and by the end of this course, you’ll have a stand-alone website you built completely from scratch.

Let’s begin!

**Available on [Envato Tuts+](https://tutsplus.com/courses) from April, 2018**
